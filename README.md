# Clue 
If you want to edit the script, open the create file and click the pencil to edit. From there, make the edits you want, and then make a pull request with it. I can approve or disprove the pull request later. 

All of the script comments need
> printf "

In the front and 
> " >> /home/(room)/lookaround

at the back. 

Feel free to edit away and make it better, all of the issues or things we need to work on feel free to add to the issues

## Running the files

If you want to create it, first log in as root (just type "sudo su")

Then type in "cd /home"

Then type in "cp /mnt/c/Users/(whatever your username is)/(wherever you installed it) create"

Then type in "chmod 777"

Then type in "./create"

All of the directories and users should be added and you're good to go!

Just make sure to type in "su clue" to start

If you want to delete it type
> chmod 777 del

> ./del

Make sure you're doing these operations in the /home directory
