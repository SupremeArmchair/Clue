# Clue
printf "Welcome to Clue! In Clue, you are a detective tasked with finding a murderer. To navigate through Clue, you change users on the linux command line. This is done through 'su (room)'. To change users, you will have to use a password cracking tool, such as hashcat to get the password for the room. To begin, type in 'su entrance'. Have fun!\n" >> /home/clue/lookaround

# Entrance
printf "You are greeted by Butler Wadsworth and are handed an envelope with your name across the front in cursive. You open it and find only this written on a note: ‘Dear Detective, if you wish to continue into the house, you will need the password. 28bc8c78881b2f89bbeab4f9bb8fbeda’. This appears familiar to you and you recollect that you’ve seen this type of MD5 hash before. Can you figure out the password to enter the hall? Helpful commands: su, man, hashcat. The password has a length of four, so try using 'hashcat (password hash) -m 0 -a 3 ?l?l?l?l\n" >>/home/entrance/lookaround
printf "Hint: What type of attack doesn’t need to be compared to a word list? Use the command hashcat --help for more information and syntax examples.\n" >> /home/entrance/hint1
printf "Hint: The MD5 algorithm is a widely used hash function producing a 128-bit hash value. Although MD5 was initially designed to be used as a cryptographic hash function, it has been found to suffer from extensive vulnerabilities. It can still be used as a checksum to verify data integrity, but only against unintentional corruption. Like most hash functions, MD5 is neither encryption nor encoding. It can be cracked by brute-force attack and suffers from extensive vulnerabilities as detailed in the security section below.\n" >> /home/entrance/hint2
printf ${hashes[0]} >> /home/entrance/hashedpassword

# Hall
printf "As you enter the hall, you are greeted by the six suspects. Your sergeant informs you of their names: Col. Mustard, Mrs. Peacock, Mrs. White, Prof. Plum, Miss Scarlett, and Mr. Green. You give the suspects a look over before telling them to go to the room they were in at the time of the murder. You turn towards the lounge, heading to see the body, Mr. Boddy’s body that is, when a slip of paper on the floor catches your eye. Out of curiosity you bend down and pick it up and find the following scrawled across the note: ‘e8c482645c1344206acfc8d47ebf6557’. You think you’ve seen this type of hash before when you were researching SHA hashes. It seems the lounge requires a password to enter, can you decode the note? Helpful commands: su, man, hashcat. The password has a length of six, so try using 'hashcat (password hash) -a 0 -m 100 ?u?u?u?d?u?u\n" >>/home/hall/lookaround
printf "The Secure Hash Algorithms(SHA) are a family of cryptographic hash functions published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as a U.S. Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS), including: SHA-0, SHA-1, SHA-2(also known as SHA-256 and SHA-512), and SHA-3.\n" >> /home/hall/hint1
printf "Hint: Similar as the password before but with a different hash…\n" >> /home/hall/hint2

# Lounge
printf "You enter a beautifully ornate lounge complete with a Persian rug, which was partly obstructed from view by a sprawled out dead body. You slowly pace over to Mr. Boddy, when suddenly a burst of flames jump out from the fireplace. You notice a few letters jutting out of the blaze. Out of instinct you reach for them. A few crumble into ashes in your hand, but you can still make out what was written on one of them: ‘fe01d67a002dfa0f3ac084298142eccd’. You decide to forgo inspecting Mr. Boddy’s body, but rather head to the ballroom. But this door looks like it also needs a password...Maybe the letters from the flames can help? Helpful commands: su, man, hashcat. The password has a length of six, so try using 'hashcat (password hash) -m 0 -a 0 ?l?l?l?l?l?l\n" >> /home/lounge/lookaround
printf "Hint: Just like the two before…\n" >> /home/lounge/hint1
printf "Hint: You may have seen this hash before…\n" >> /home/lounge/hint2

# Ballroom         
printf "You wander into a massive room with a lofted ceiling, and walls covered in elaborate paintings. In the middle of the dancefloor, softly swaying to imaginary music is Miss Scarlet. Her maroon dress complements the deep amber of the floors. You begin to ask her questions about what happened. You listen to her talk about their dinner party, or lack thereof as it appears Mr. Boddy died even before dinner was served, as the two of you walk around the room. You are paying more attention to the paintings then to her really, when one catches your eye. The sheer beauty of the painting completely pulls your attention away from Miss Scarlett. Who knew dogs playing poker could be so profound. But the painting is tilted! You go to straighten it out but an envelope falls out. Scribbled across the top is: ‘e95e294e1feb382c08f435e509e121be’. Inside you find a list of what you think are different dog breeds. Could you use this list to decode the password? Maybe it's a hint as to who killed Mr. Boddy? You decided to decode it before you head over to the dining room. Helpful commands: su, man, hashcat -a 3\n" >>/home/ballroom/lookaround
printf "Hint: This is a dictionary attack: an attempted illegal entry to a computer system that uses a dictionary headword list to generate possible passwords\n" >> /home/ballroom/hint1
printf "Hint: Look in the ballroom folder: is there a dictionary file you could use?\n" >> /home/ballroom/hint2

# Dining Room
printf "It seems that Wadsworth is in the process of preparing dinner. You wander around the table and go to take a sip of the soup at your seat. But there is no spoon! Rather on the table lies a leap pipe. You look at the lead pipe for a second before deciding to use it as a straw and slurp up the soup. Hmm, the flavor reminds you of stone soup from the children’s book you loved as a child. You reach for the napkin on the table to dry off the pipe, but as you pick it up a notes falls out and lands in the soup. You fish it out quickly, but most of the writing has already dissolved. You can still make out this on the front: ‘6104df369888589d6dbea304b59a32d4’ and a small note in the corner that you think says rockyou. You go to check out the kitchen but you notice a giant padlock on the door. Can you figure out the code? Helpful commands: su, man, hashcat -a 3\n" >>/home/diningroom/lookaround
printf "Hint: Rockyou was a company that made widgets for MySpace and in December 2009, the company experienced a data breach resulting in the exposure of over 32 million user accounts. This resulted from storing user data in an unencrypted database (including user passwords in plain text instead of using a cryptographic hash) and not patching a ten-year-old SQL vulnerability. RockYou failed to provide a notification of the breach to users and miscommunicated the extent of the breach. The RockYou wordlist is well known and easy to find online.\n" >> /home/diningroom/hint1

# Kitchen
printf "Upon entering the kitchen, you notice that it is empty of suspects. You spot a dog-eared cookbook for fruit pies lying on the counter, right next to a full rack of knives. Obviously Mr. Boddy was not stabbed with a knife! You decide to focus your energy on the pies. The cookbook looks well-loved and is dusted with flour. As you pick it up to find your favorite pie recipe(pumpkin!), a piece of paper flutters out from between the pages. In black ink it reads: ‘fc369d54db02c2bfab6d354b6ced05f9’ and ‘billiardroom’. The hash looks familiar. You should be comfortable with this type of attack by now, but be warned, you might need to double your efforts for cracking it. Helpful commands: su, man, hashcat -a 3\n" >>/home/kitchen/lookaround
printf "Hint: The use of two dictionaries is called a combinator attack. Is there dictionaries you have you could use?\n" >> /home/kitchen/hint1

# Billiard Room
printf "In The Billiard Room, You Find Col. Mustard Playing A Game Of Billiards. Upon Entering The Room, The Colonel Takes It Upon Himself To Tell You About His Time In The Army. You Begin To Zone Out As He Rambles On Until Something Strange Catches Your Eye. Sitting On The Mantel Was A Candlestick Holding The Eight Ball. You Move Across The Room And Pick Up The Ball. As You Do, You Notice Something Etched Into The Side Of The Ball: ‘ 269cb914b20d49fb2f7cc5b1f602b7aa’. Holding The Ball Tentatively In Your Hand, You Search The Room For Hints To Solve This Hash. Hopefully You Can Solve It Fast So That You Can Duck Out On The Colonel’s Boring Story And Into The Conservatory. Helpful commands: su, man, hashcat -r\n" >>/home/billiardroom/lookaround
printf "Hint: A rule-based attack is a way of focusing a password cracking technique when the attacker knows something about the password, such as the password being alphanumeric and having the length of eight.\n" >> /home/billiardroom/hint1
printf "Hint : Dictionary Attack with a rule (-r)! What Could The Rule Be?\n" >> /home/billiardroom/hint2

# Conservatory
printf "You knock on the door and then nope it, \$tepping into the conservatory and are met by Mr$. White. She lunges for uyo seductively dan you manage to jump tou of her way but unfortunately, you accidentally knock over a potted fern. The terracotta pot breaks and dirt spills over the floor. gLookin clo\$er you see a folded scrap of paper under the leaves and \$oil. You unfold it dan it reads: ‘56fd8349277eaa3602b5e4417be01588’. Solve this fast! Apparently Mrs. White is on the lookout for husband #6! You can escape to the study if you can \$peed past Mrs. White and unlock the door. Helpful commands: su, man, hashcat -r\n" >>/home/conservatory/lookaround
printf "Hint : Dinosaur = rDino\$au, for more hints, look back at the script...see anything funny going on?\n" >> /home/conservatory/hint1

# Study
printf "The floor creaks as you step into the study. A huge desk occupies most of the space and the wood paneling of the walls is illuminated by the soft light of a lamp and the flicker of the fireplace. A large oil painting of a General in uniform with an impressive moustache glares down at you. Several ornate venetian masks are mounted on the walls, the purple paint and gold trim gleam in the warm light. You notice a long rope laying across the desk. As you pick up the rope, a layer of dust falls off it. Obviously the rope has not been moved in a while. The dust makes you sneeze and as you tilt your head, you notice that several letters are scattered across the windowsill, but only one has been opened. You turn over the ripped envelope and notice some text scribbled next to the address line. It reads: ‘64b83bc470b544f57738f804d298c4be’ . Could this be your next clue? Maybe this has something to do with Mr. Boddy’s CON? All this mystery really makes you want to step out for a breath of fresh air. Maybe the patio is where you head next… Helpful commands: su, man, hashcat -r\n" >> /home/study/lookaround
printf "Hint : You now this one starts with CON…. followed by 6 capital letters.\n" >> /home/study/hint1

# Patio
printf "Lightning cracks as you step out onto the patio. So much for that calming fresh air. You hear soft sobs and notice Mrs. Peacock crying under the umbrella. Something about her senator husband and the horror of this ordeal. The sound of rain mixed with Mrs. Peacock’s sobbing is deafening as you make your way to the door on the other side. You find it unsurprisingly locked and look around the patio for hints to escape this awkwardness. You see a television flashing strange lines of text in the corner and decide to inspect it. The text looks familiar to you but you are only able to catch: ‘0668794C9BA769EA2F0BF886688FE279:F76E5CA96C69961CFCA54BAAD7E355F0’. You think this looks like a hashed Windows password. Can you decode this and open the door into the library?\n" >> /home/patio/lookaround
printf "Hint : Try Ophcrack, you may have to look at its man page for help\n" >> /home/patio/hint1

# Library
printf "Closing the door behind you and finally being able to escape Mrs. Peacock’s sobs, you bump right into Mr. Green. You notice his collar - he must be a priest. And its less than a minute before he begins to talk about God and sins and humanity and on and on. You scan the room for something to distract you from having to engage in this theological lecture. The far wall is filled with what appears to be cords and flashing lights. One of those fancy new computers that Mr. Boddy used it in his scientific work for the government. As you approach the computer with caution, you notice that it looks like someone has used it recently. You find a bunch of miscellaneous files and a hash, ‘e8416709aac514529e6eb2c1fb8ab00b’. The line underneath is indicates that the password begins with CLUE- followed by 4 digits. All this stress makes you wish you could go relax at the spa.\n" >> /home/library/lookaround
printf "Hint: Just like the Study!\n" >> /home/library/hint1

# Spa
printf "You enter the spa and wish that you could take a moment away from the case to relax, but alas, a murderer is on the loose. Stopping for a moment to rest on the spa bed, you notice through the head hole a revolver laying on the floor. You pick up the gun and sniff it. It has not been fired recently! You pop it open and notice it is empty - useless! You toss it aside and you start to think...something is missing...someone is missing….You make your way towards the door when it suddenly slams shut. You’ve been locked in! You start going through a checklist of rooms you’ve visited, things you’ve found, and people you’ve talked to…. You think you have it but you must escape this room and track down the killer! The only room left is the cellar! That’s where the killer is! But how do you get to the cellar? You search the room for a clue. You pick up a towel - maybe you’ll break a window - when you notice something written on the tag. It says: ‘4aa3a8ea444f191c8bafc7d3a71be294’. You’ve done this before, but this time the clue is SUSPECTS-, followed by four capital letters and then two digits. You know what to do!\n" >> /home/spa/lookaround
printf "Hint: The password may look something like this: SUSPECTS-NOPE99\n" > /home/spa/hint1

# Cellar
printf "You approach the cellar to confront the murderer, finally escaping the spa. You hear strange noises behind the door as you prepare to open it. You really wish you had kept any of the weapons you had found because here you are weaponless. You take a deep breath and whip the door open. You look up to find yourself face to face with Prof. Plum! You demand answers from the Professor! He laughs and begins to ramble on about his work, some paper he published, a doctoral student named Constance, an inappropriate relationship, plagiarism, the UN! These are the ramblings of a madman. He raises his arm up and clutched in his hand is …. THE WRENCH!!! IT’S PROFESSOR PLUM WITH THE WRENCH IN THE LOUNGE! He lunges at you, you dodge out of the way and knock over salt in the process. Why is there salt in the cellar?! Maybe it's a hint about the password... It is clear to you now, but you’ll have to act fast if you want to stop him! After you complete this challenge, go to the endgame\n" >> /home/cellar/lookaround
printf "Hint : In cryptography, a salt is random data that is used as an additional input to a one-way function that "hashes" data, a password or passphrase. Salts are closely related to the concept of nonce. The primary function of salts is to defend against dictionary attacks or against its hashed equivalent, a pre-computed rainbow table attack.\n" >> /home/cellar/hint1
printf "Hint : 2b or not 2b, that is the question….. Shakespeare was a great ENGLISH playwright\n" >> /home/cellar/hint2
printf "Hint : You might need to double down on your efforts.\n" >> /home/cellar/hint3

# Endgame
printf "You dodge out of the way of the swinging Professor. Bending down, you grab the spilled salt and hurl in into Prof. Plum’s eyes. “MY EYES!”, screams Prof. Plum, dropping the wrench to claw at his eyes. You shove him to the ground and struggle to pull his hands behind his back and cuff him. Finally, he gives in and stop thrashing around and you are able to cuff him and drag him to his feet. You walk him back to the entrance and hand him off to your sergeant. Phew, you survived!\n" >> /home/endgame/lookaround
